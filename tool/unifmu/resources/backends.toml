# This file defines which files should be copied over when generating a new FMU.
# For each backend a "files" attribute MUST specify which resources to copy over to the FMU.
#
# GLOBS are NOT currently supported
#
# ALL files in the tool/unifmu/resources are available as the "source" side of the command.
# source paths are relative to this directory, whereas destionation paths are relative to the FMU's root
